    "You can figure no one on any continent has ever called Mona Eltahawy a \"shrinking violet.\" She's a globally-known critic of misogyny in Islam and a hard-driving journalist not afraid to confront the powerful. The title of her latest book gives a hint of her \"direct\" nature: <em>Headscarves and Hymens: Why the Middle East Needs a Sexual Revolution</em>. She proudly accepts the label \"radical feminist Muslim.\""
