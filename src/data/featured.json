    "Stanford professor and renowned political scientist Francis Fukuyama has written two books about the history of the modern state. His first, <em>The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution</em>, was critically acclaimed and leads to his second.",
    "The just released <em>Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy</em> looks at many nations, but, as reviewers have noted, has some positive things to say about the American system."
