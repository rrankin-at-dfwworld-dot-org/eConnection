    "David Axelrod's career change &mdash; from journalist to campaign adviser &mdash; took him from Chicago's local races to White House politics as \"the mastermind behind Barack Obama's historic election campaigns.\"",
    "He has written about his career &mdash; and his long friendship with President Obama &mdash; in the book, <em>Believer: My Forty Years in Politics</em>.",
    "While the triumphs have been many and spectacular, he has also worked with one star that flamed out, serving as an advisor for young candidate Rod Blagojevich who later would become governor of Illinois.  Ironically, Blagojevich lost that job and was sent to prison for soliciting bribes, including an attempt to \"sell\" the senate seat just vacated by Axelrod's successful candidate, President Obama.",
    "In addition to advising the campaigns, he also served as senior advisor to the President through 2011. Since 2013, he has been executive director of the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. "
