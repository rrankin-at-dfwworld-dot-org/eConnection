    "Fredrik Logevall is a renowned scholar and Cornell University professor who won the Pulitzer Prize for History with his most recent book, <em>Embers of War: The Fall of An Empire and the Making of America's Vietnam</em>. In a work described as \"written with the style of a great novelist and the intrigue of a Cold War thriller,\" Logevall provides an understanding of America's entrance into a war in Vietnam in the aftermath of France's defeat and departure. The book demonstrates that war is not without post-conflict consequences."
